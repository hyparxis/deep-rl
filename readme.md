## NOTE: this version of the library is no longer actively developed. New development has moved to [@osudrl/apex](https://github.com/osudrl/apex) 

This is a small, modular library that contains some implementations of continuous reinforcement learning algorithms. Fully compatible with OpenAI gym.

## Running experiments

### Basics
An example of running an experiment using vanilla policy gradient is shown in ```examples/vpg.py```.

```python
env = gym.make("Hopper-v1")

obs_dim = env.observation_space.shape[0]
action_dim = env.action_space.shape[0]

policy = GaussianMLP(obs_dim, action_dim)

algo = PPO(
    env=env,
    policy=policy,
    lr=args.lr,
)
```
This script shows the basics of defining a model and setting up an algorithm. The recommended way to train the model, log diagnostics, and visualize the current policy all at once is to use the ```rl.utils.run_experiment()``` function.

```python
run_experiment(algo, args, log=True, render=True, monitor=True)
```

This sets up the logging, launches a progress monitor in your browser, renders the policy continuously in a seperate thread, and executes ```algo.train()``` according to your hyperparameters in ```args```.

### Logging details
For the logger to work properly, you want to supply all of your hyperparameters via command line arguments through argparser, and pass the resulting object to an instance of ```rl.utils.Logger```. Algorithms take care of their own diagnostic logging; if you don't wont to log anything, simply don't pass a logger object to ```algo.train()```.

Beyond your algorithm hyperparameters, the Logger expects that you supply an argument named ```logdir```, containing the root directory you want to store your logfiles in, and an argument named ```seed```, which is used to seed the pseudorandom number generators.

An basic command line script illustrating this is:
```bash
python examples/vpg.py --logdir experiments/ --seed l337
```

The resulting directory tree would look something like this:
```
experiments/
└── e2374a18f0
    ├── experiment.info
    └── seed1337.log
```
With ```e2374a18f0``` being a hash uniquely generated from the hyperparameter values used, ```experiment.info``` being a plaintext file listing those hyperparameters, and ```seed1337.log``` being a tab-seperated-value file containing the logged diagnostics (e.g. reward, kl divergence, etc) for each iteration.

This file structure makes it easy to compare models generated using the same hyperparameters but different seeds, and neatly seperates experiments by hyperparameter settings.

## Monitoring live training progress

### With Vizdom
I've deprecated the bokeh monitor. Info on monitoring with vizdom coming soon. TODO: make a plotting config file format (e.g. use timesteps vs iterations on the x axis, use a fixed vs variable x axis, choose what kind of filtering to do).

Run ```$ python -m visdom.server``` then navigate to ```http://localhost:8097/``` in your browser

Requires matplotlib >= 2.0

## Unit tests
You can run the unit tests using pytest.

### To Do
- [ ] Sphinx documentation and github wiki
- [ ] Make logger as robust and pythonic as possible
- [ ] Fix some hacks having to do with support for parallelism 
(namely Vectorize, Normalize and Monitor)
- [ ] ADD PARALLELISM/DISTRIBUTED IMPLEMENTATIONS

### Notes

Troubleshooting: X module not found? Make sure PYTHONPATH is configured. Make sure you run 
examples from root directory.

Thanks to @ikostrikov's whose great implementations I used to debug my own, and inspired a lot of changes to my original code. Also thanks to @rll for rllab, which inspired a lot of the high level interface and logging for this library, and to @OpenAI for the original PPO tensorflow implementation.
